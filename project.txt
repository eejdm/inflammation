Project Kickoff Meeting:

Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time post-surgery.

Jane is a data scientist and Samit is a statistician. We will need to determine who is responcible for what in this project.

We may need to bring in a third person with python programming skills into this project.
We imagine this person will need to know about Pandas and MatPlotLib.

Third team member will be responsible for the framework of the programming.
