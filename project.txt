Project Kickoff Meeting:

Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time post-surgery.

Jane is a data scientist and Samit is a statistician. We will need to determine who is responcible for what in this project.

We may need to bring in a third person with python programming skills into this project.
we imagine this person will need to know about Pandas and MatPlotLib.
